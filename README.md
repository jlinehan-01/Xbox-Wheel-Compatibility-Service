# Xbox Wheel Compatibility

This project aims to allow Xbox One racing wheels to be used with PC. This project was inspired by https://github.com/cmumme/XboxWheelCompatibility, however will use C++ instead of C# to avoid issues with .NET which caused the installer to fail, and to provide a more lightweight experience.
